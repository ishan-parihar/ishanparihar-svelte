#### **Initial Vision & Requirements**
**Original Project Scope**:
- **Primary Goal**: Personal portfolio website showcasing spiritual guidance services
- **Target Audience**: Individuals seeking consciousness development and spiritual growth
- **Technical Requirements**: Fast loading, SEO-optimized, mobile-responsive design
- **Business Model**: Lead generation for 1-on-1 coaching services

**Early Technology Choices**:
```typescript
// Initial technology stack (Phase 1)
const initialStack = {
  frontend: "Next.js 13 (Pages Router)",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS",
  database: "Supabase (PostgreSQL)",
  authentication: "Supabase Auth",
  deployment: "Vercel",
  contentManagement: "Markdown files"
};
```

**Architectural Principles Established**:
- **Performance First**: Sub-3s loading times as primary requirement
- **SEO Optimization**: Server-side rendering for all public content
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive design with mobile optimization priority
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from day one
- **Scalability**: Architecture designed to handle growth from individual to enterprise

#### **Initial Implementation Patterns**
**Early Component Architecture**:
```typescript
// Original component structure (simplified)
const EarlyComponentStructure = {
  pages: [
    "index.tsx",           // Homepage
    "about.tsx",           // About page
    "services.tsx",        // Services overview
    "contact.tsx",         // Contact form
    "blog/[slug].tsx"      // Blog posts
  ],
  components: [
    "Header.tsx",          // Navigation
    "Footer.tsx",          // Footer
    "Layout.tsx",          // Page wrapper

    "BlogPost.tsx"         // Blog post display
  ],
  styles: "globals.css"    // Single CSS file
};
```

**Database Schema Evolution**:
```sql
-- Initial database schema (Phase 1)
CREATE TABLE blog_posts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
