# Architectural Brief: NextJS to Svelte Migration

## Architectural Decisions
- **ADR-01: Incremental Migration Strategy**
  - **Context:** The platform is enterprise-grade with complex authentication, data management, and payment processing. A big-bang migration would be too risky.
  - **Decision:** Implement a phased approach following the 5-phase strategy outlined in the blueprint, starting with foundation setup and progressing through core functionality, business logic, advanced features, and integration/testing.
  - **Justification:** Minimizes risk, allows for parallel development, and ensures business continuity during migration.

- **ADR-02: Authentication System Selection**
  - **Context:** The current system uses NextAuth.js with Supabase RLS, multi-provider support, and JWT sessions.
  - **Decision:** Use Lucia authentication library for its lightweight, database-agnostic design that integrates well with SvelteKit.
  - **Justification:** Lucia provides the flexibility needed to preserve existing JWT token structure and validation logic while offering SvelteKit-native integration.

- **ADR-03: Data Fetching Architecture**
  - **Context:** Current system uses tRPC with React Query for type-safe API calls and sophisticated caching.
  - **Decision:** Replace tRPC with direct REST API calls to existing backend while leveraging SvelteKit load functions for server-side data fetching.
  - **Justification:** Maintains backend compatibility while utilizing SvelteKit's built-in data fetching capabilities and caching mechanisms.

- **ADR-04: Component Architecture Pattern**
  - **Context:** 150+ components organized by function with complex Framer Motion animations.
  - **Decision:** Use domain-driven component organization with Svelte A11y for UI primitives and custom Svelte transitions for animations.
  - **Justification:** Preserves existing functionality while leveraging Svelte's superior reactivity and built-in animation capabilities.

## Identified Risks
- **RISK-001:** Authentication migration could cause session invalidation or security gaps.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement parallel authentication systems during transition with thorough security testing (addressed in T-003, T-004).

- **RISK-002:** Performance regression due to loss of React Query's sophisticated caching.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive performance benchmarking at each phase and leverage SvelteKit's built-in optimizations (addressed in T-012, T-016).

- **RISK-003:** Complex Framer Motion animations may not translate directly to Svelte.
  - **Mitigation:** Create Svelte-specific animation library prioritizing critical animations first (addressed in T-014).

- **RISK-004:** Data consistency issues during migration.
  - **Mitigation:** Maintain single source of truth (existing database) and implement comprehensive testing suite (addressed in T-017, T-018).
