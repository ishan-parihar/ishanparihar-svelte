# Next.js to SvelteKit Migration Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for migrating the Next.js platform to SvelteKit.

## Migration Overview

The migration is structured in 5 phases, each with detailed implementation guides:

### üìã Available Documentation

- **Phase 1**: [Critical Infrastructure Migration](./PHASE_1_CRITICAL_INFRASTRUCTURE.md)
- **Phase 2**: [Admin Dashboard Migration](./PHASE_2_ADMIN_DASHBOARD.md)
- **Phase 3**: [E-commerce & Payments Migration](./PHASE_3_ECOMMERCE_PAYMENTS.md)
- **Phase 4**: [Advanced Features Migration](./PHASE_4_ADVANCED_FEATURES.md)
- **Phase 5**: [Testing & Deployment](./PHASE_5_TESTING_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. **Read the Analysis Report**
Start with the [Migration Analysis Report](../MIGRATION_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md) to understand the current migration status and requirements.

### 2. **Follow the Phases Sequentially**
Each phase builds upon the previous one. Complete Phase 1 before starting Phase 2, and so on.

### 3. **Team Requirements**
- **Phase 1-2**: 2-3 Full-stack developers
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 Full-stack developers + 1 DevOps engineer
- **Phase 4-5**: 2-3 Full-stack developers + 1 DevOps engineer

### 4. **Timeline**
- **Total Duration**: 10 weeks
- **Critical Path**: 6 weeks (Phases 1-2)
- **Buffer Time**: 2 weeks for unexpected challenges
- **Testing & Deployment**: 2 weeks

## Migration Status

- **Current Status**: ~20-25% Complete
- **Next Priority**: Phase 1 - Critical Infrastructure
- **Estimated Completion**: 10 weeks with dedicated team

## Key Features Being Migrated

### ‚úÖ **Completed (Basic Level)**
- Core UI components (Button, Card, Header, Navigation)
- Basic authentication with Lucia + Google OAuth
- Simple page structure (home, blog, auth pages)
- Development setup (testing, build system, Tailwind CSS)

### ‚ùå **Critical Missing Features**

#### üî¥ **High Priority**
- **Complete Admin Dashboard** (0% migrated)
- **tRPC API System** (0% migrated)
- **E-commerce & Payment System** (0% migrated)
- **Customer Support System** (0% migrated)
- **Newsletter Management** (0% migrated)

#### üü° **Medium Priority**
- **Advanced Blog Features** (30% migrated)
- **User Account Management** (10% migrated)
- **Performance & SEO Features** (0% migrated)
- **Analytics Integration** (0% migrated)

## Architecture Differences

### Next.js ‚Üí SvelteKit

| Aspect | Next.js | SvelteKit | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Routing** | File-based with `pages/` | File-based with `routes/` | Similar structure, different conventions |
| **API** | tRPC with type safety | SvelteKit API routes | Need to recreate all API endpoints |
| **Auth** | NextAuth.js | Lucia | Authentication system completely different |
| **State Mgmt** | React Query + Zustand | Svelte stores | Different patterns, same outcomes |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Tailwind CSS | Same styling system |
| **Testing** | Jest + Testing Library | Vitest + Playwright | Different tools, same goals |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (optimized) | Vercel (native) | Same platform, better performance |

## Getting Started

### For Development Team

1. **Review the Analysis Report**
   ```bash
   cat MIGRATION_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md
   ```

2. **Start with Phase 1**
   ```bash
   cd migration_docs
   cat PHASE_1_CRITICAL_INFRASTRUCTURE.md
   ```

3. **Set Up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   cd ../ishanparihar-svelte-migrated
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Follow the Phase Guides**
   Each phase includes:
   - Detailed implementation steps
   - Code examples
   - Testing strategies
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Success criteria

### For Project Managers

1. **Review the Timeline**
   - 10 weeks total duration
   - 2-3 developers per phase
   - Critical path: 6 weeks

2. **Check Dependencies**
   - Phase 1: No dependencies
   - Phase 2: Requires Phase 1 completion
   - Phase 3: Requires Phase 1 & 2 completion
   - Phase 4: Requires Phase 1, 2, & 3 completion
   - Phase 5: Requires all previous phases

3. **Monitor Progress**
   - Each phase has clear success criteria
   - Regular status updates and reporting
   - Risk mitigation strategies included

## Important Notes

### üö® **Critical Dependencies**
- **Phase 1** is blocking for all other phases
- **tRPC to SvelteKit API migration** is the most complex part
- **Payment gateway setup** required for Phase 3
- **Database schema compatibility** must be maintained

### üìã **Documentation Structure**
- Each phase is self-contained with complete implementation guides
- Code examples are production-ready
- Testing strategies for each phase
- Common issues and solutions included
- Success criteria clearly defined

### üîß **Technical Considerations**
- **Database**: Same Supabase database, different client libraries
- **Authentication**: Lucia instead of NextAuth, same OAuth providers
- **API**: SvelteKit routes instead of tRPC, same endpoints
- **State**: Svelte stores instead of React Query, same patterns
- **Styling**: Same Tailwind CSS configuration

### üìä **Performance Expectations**
- **SvelteKit**: Better runtime performance (smaller bundles)
- **Build Times**: Faster builds with Vite
- **Load Times**: Improved initial page loads
- **Bundle Size**: Smaller JavaScript bundles
