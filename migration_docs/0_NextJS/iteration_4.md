# Backend Services and API Integrations Analysis

## I. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the backend services and API integrations in the Ishan Parihar platform. The system utilizes tRPC for type-safe API communication, integrates with Razorpay for payment processing, implements a robust authentication system with NextAuth.js, and incorporates various external services for email notifications and newsletter management. The architecture follows modern best practices with clear separation of concerns between API routes, business logic, and data access layers.

## II. Deep Dive

### 1. tRPC API Routers Structure and Function

#### Overview
The application uses tRPC (TypeScript RPC) to create end-to-end typesafe APIs. The routers are organized in `apps/platform/src/server/api/routers/` with each file handling a specific domain of functionality.

#### Key Routers and Their Functions:

1. **Payments Router (`payments.ts`)**
   - Handles payment processing and order management
   - Integrates with Razorpay for payment gateway functionality
   - Manages order creation, payment verification, and order status tracking
   - Supports multiple currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, INR, CAD, AUD, SGD, HKD, MYR)
   - Provides admin endpoints for order management and sales analytics

2. **Authentication Router (`auth.ts`)**
   - Manages user registration, login, and profile operations
   - Handles email verification and password reset functionality
   - Implements session management and user data retrieval
   - Integrates with NextAuth.js for authentication flows

3. **Blog Router (`blog.ts`)**
   - Manages blog posts, categories, comments, and engagement
   - Handles content creation, modification, and retrieval
   - Implements comment systems with moderation capabilities
   - Supports blog post engagement tracking (views, likes, bookmarks)

4. **Services Router (`services.ts`)**
   - Manages products and services offered
   - Handles service categories and pricing information
   - Provides admin interfaces for service management

5. **Support Router (`support.ts`)**
   - Implements ticketing system for customer support
   - Manages chat sessions between customers and support staff
   - Provides admin dashboards for ticket and chat management
   - Handles notification systems for support activities

#### Router Organization Principles:
- Each router corresponds to a specific business domain
- Procedures are categorized as public, protected, limited, or admin based on access requirements
- Input validation is implemented using Zod schemas
- Error handling follows tRPC error patterns with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Database operations use Supabase client with proper authentication context

### 2. External Service Integrations

#### Payment Gateway Integration (Razorpay)
The platform integrates with Razorpay for payment processing:

1. **Implementation Details:**
   - Uses official `razorpay` Node.js SDK
   - Supports multiple currencies through currency conversion utilities
   - Implements order creation with detailed metadata tracking
   - Handles payment verification with signature validation
   - Provides receipt generation in PDF format using `pdfkit`

2. **Key Features:**
   - Multi-currency support with automatic conversion
   - Order management with status tracking (pending, paid, failed, etc.)
   - Receipt generation and storage in Supabase storage
   - Admin dashboards for order monitoring and analytics
   - Integration with service pricing information

3. **Security Considerations:**
   - Uses environment variables for API keys
   - Implements signature verification for payment callbacks
   - Secure handling of sensitive payment information
   - Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

#### Email Service Integration
The platform implements a flexible email notification system:

1. **Implementation Details:**
   - Modular email service in `apps/platform/src/lib/email-service.ts`
   - Template-based email generation for different notification types
   - Supports both HTML and plain text email formats
   - Placeholder implementation that can be extended with providers like SendGrid or AWS SES

2. **Notification Types:**
   - Support ticket creation notifications
   - Chat session initiation alerts
   - General administrative messages
   - User authentication emails (verification, password reset)

3. **Key Features:**
   - Template system for consistent email formatting
   - Metadata embedding for contextual information
   - Development mode logging for testing
   - Extensible design for integrating with actual email providers

#### Newsletter Service Integration
A comprehensive newsletter system is implemented:

1. **Implementation Details:**
   - Dedicated service in `apps/platform/src/lib/newsletterService.ts`
   - Independent subscriber management from user accounts
   - Automatic linking of newsletter subscriptions to user accounts
   - Campaign management for content distribution

2. **Key Features:**
   - Subscription management with double opt-in support
   - Unsubscribe token handling for compliance
   - User account linking for personalized experiences
   - Campaign creation and tracking capabilities
   - Admin interfaces for subscriber management

### 3. Authentication and Authorization Middleware

#### Authentication System
The platform uses NextAuth.js for authentication with custom implementations:

1. **Core Components:**
   - Session management in `apps/platform/src/lib/trpc.ts`
   - Custom email provider in `apps/platform/src/lib/simple-email-provider.ts`
   - Authentication utilities in `apps/platform/src/lib/auth.ts`

2. **Key Features:**
   - Multiple authentication providers support (Google, email/password)
   - JWT-based session management
   - Role-based access control (user, admin)
   - Session persistence across requests
   - Secure token handling and verification

#### Authorization Middleware
The tRPC implementation includes several authorization layers:

1. **Procedure Types:**
   - `publicProcedure`: No authentication required
   - `protectedProcedure`: Requires any authenticated user
   - `limitedProcedure`: Blocks spam-flagged users from specific actions
   - `adminProcedure`: Requires admin privileges

2. **Permission System:**
   - Granular permission scopes defined in `PERMISSION_SCOPES`
   - Role-based permission checking
   - Session validation for each request
   - Custom permission procedure factory for fine-grained access control

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - Middleware functions that intercept requests before procedure execution
   - Session context propagation to all procedures
   - Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
   - User role and permission validation

## III. Architectural Context

The backend services architecture follows a layered approach with clear separation of concerns:

1. **API Layer**: tRPC routers provide the interface between frontend and backend services
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Service files implement core functionality and orchestrate operations
3. **Data Access Layer**: Supabase client handles database operations with appropriate authentication
4. **Integration Layer**: External service clients (Razorpay, email providers) handle third-party communications

This architecture enables:
- Type-safe communication between frontend and backend
- Easy testing and mocking of services
- Scalable addition of new features and integrations
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Proper security isolation between components
