# SvelteKit Migration Documentation

## Overview
This documentation provides comprehensive guidance for completing the migration from the Next.js platform to the SvelteKit application. The migration process is divided into three main phases, each addressing different aspects of the application functionality.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Features (Immediate Priority)
Features that are essential for basic business operations and must be implemented first.

### Phase 2: Business-Critical Features
Features that are important for business operations but can be implemented after Phase 1.

### Phase 3: Enhancement Features
Features that improve user experience and operational efficiency.
