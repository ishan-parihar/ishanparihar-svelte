# Testing Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing guidelines for the SvelteKit migration project. It covers testing strategies, methodologies, and best practices to ensure quality, reliability, and maintainability of the application across all three migration phases.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach
The project will follow a test-driven development approach where:

- Tests are written before the implementation code
- Tests drive the design and architecture of components
- Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior
- Tests provide confidence for refactoring and feature additions

### 2. Testing Pyramid
The testing approach follows the testing pyramid principle:

**Unit Tests (70% of tests)**
- Test individual functions, components, and modules
- Fast execution and focused scope
- High code coverage for business logic

**Integration Tests (20% of tests)**
- Test interactions between components and services
- Validate API endpoints and database operations
- Verify proper integration of different modules

**End-to-End Tests (10% of tests)**
- Test complete user workflows
- Validate critical business processes
- Ensure system works in production-like environment

### 3. Testing Priorities
Testing priorities align with business impact:

1. **Critical Business Functions**: Authentication, payments, core user workflows
2. **Security Features**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
3. **Performance-Sensitive Areas**: Search, data display, API responses
4. **User Experience**: Forms, navigation, responsive design
5. **Integration Points**: Third-party services, APIs, databases

## Unit Testing Guidelines

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup code
  });

  it('should render correctly with props', async () => {
