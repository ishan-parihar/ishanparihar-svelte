// DB adapter for Lucia auth
// This is a placeholder implementation
// In a real implementation, you would use a proper database adapter

// For now, since we're using Supabase, we might want to create a custom adapter
// or use the existing Supabase authentication instead of Lucia
// This is a simplified version for demonstration

import { createServiceRoleClient } from './supabase';

// Mock adapter - in a real implementation you would connect to your actual database
export const adapter = {
  // This would need to be implemented based on your database
  // For now, using a placeholder since we're using Supabase
};

// For now, let's just export the adapter as null and update the auth.ts file
// to use Supabase instead of Lucia if needed
